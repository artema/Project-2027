<P>Versalife Introduces New 'Savior' Beans Meant to End Global Hunger

<P>Versalife Corporation revealed today their new line of genetically modified soybeans, dubbed, 'Savior' Beans. Corporate spokesman, Gerard St. John Sr., revealed the patented beans live at the Agricultural Conference in Mumbai, India. If the claims prove true, 'Savior' beans will be the first crop ever to be able to grow in almost any climate. "'Savior' Beans don't just grow in any climate and in any soil, but they also produce extremely large harvests rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, and other nutrients, while fixating nitrogen and feeding other chemicals necessary for healthy plant growth back into the soil," explained St. John, right before he tossed a handful into his mouth, "and they're pretty tasty too!"

Versalife has already applied to the newly formed 'Coporations for Global Health and Satiation', currently spearheaded by food chain McDonald's and agricultural giant, Monsanto, which, though unavailable for comment, must view the 'Savior' Bean as serious competition to their previously unmatched line of genetically modified crops.

<P>The new development has brought on a firestorm of protests from "pure food" supporters. The WwGMP (World without Genetically Modified Products) appeals the global community to block the advance of this newest kind of "mutant food", citing the environmental and health hazards stemming from the use of such habitat unfriendly genetically modified 'super-crops'.
