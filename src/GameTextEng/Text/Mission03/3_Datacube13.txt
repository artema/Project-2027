<P>Entry #445642#

<P>I got sacked. Those god damn black suits are to blame. I don't know what they said to my boss, but my ass was on the street with no explanation. I've got some friends in the sports bar, and thankfully they helped me get a job. Bad news is, my salary is now half what it used to be. I'm trying to find a new source of income, but I might end up selling that stuff I've been keeping for Daniel...

<P>I'm being followed, I know it. I'm not paranoid, but I've been seeing stuff. I've decided to avoid our secret crib. I'm thinking, he's the main target, not me. If I stay away long enough maybe eventually they'll bugger off.

<P>As I entered my room yesterday I noticed that someone had been there. Nothing was stolen... I nearly missed it, but my favorite book was moved. The only explanation that fits is someone was searching for something. Whatever it was, I hope they didn't find it, or maybe they did and they'll leave me alone now. I deleted all the information about our crib... can't let them get that.

<P>this whole thing has got me on edge, i'm having trouble sleeping, i never feel safe, liife is starting to seem unreaal, like this terrible nightmare ill wake up from at any moment. I'm not even sure anymore if im not hallucinating the whole thing in some sort of late onset schizophrenia. I... think... I'm... being... followed... it's crazy right? I lost my job, my friends, i isolate myself more often than not, i'm soon to be evicted... yesterday i nearly pulled a gun on my elderly neighbor. god, i need help... if this doesn't end soon, maybe this is a dream, all i need to do is jump off a building and ill wake up right before i hit the sidewalk...
