<P>A Guide to Modern Weapons: Chapter 5: The Heckler & Koch G36
<P>The Heckler & Koch G36 is a 5.56x45mm gas-operated assault rifle, designed in the early 1990s by Heckler & Koch (H&K) in Germany as a replacement for the 7.62mm G3 battle rifle.
<P>Work on a successor for the venerable G3 rifle had been ongoing in Germany since the second half of the 1970s. After a series of innovative, if rejected (for politico-economic reasons), 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge models, the HK50 was produced and trialed to ratings higher than the rival Austrian Steyr AUG system. First adopted by Bundeswehr's NATO Quick Reaction Force in 1997, and later becoming the standard rifle for the Spanish Armed Forces in 1998, the Bundeswehr designated Gewehr G36 is now utilized by military forces all over the world.
<P>The G36 feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazine or 100-round C-Mag drum magazine and fires from a closed rotary bolt. The weapon features a conventional layout and a modular component design; the weapon can be stripped and re-assembled without tools through a system of cross-pins similar to that used on earlier HK designs. For cleaning purposes, the G36 disassembles into the receiver housing, return mechanism, bolt carrier group, and trigger group.
<P>The rifle can be fitted with a 40 mm AG36 (AG - Anbau-Granatwerfer) under-barrel grenade launcher, which is a breech-loaded break action weapon with a side-tilting barrel. Standard equipment supplied with the G36 includes: spare magazines, a cleaning and maintenance kit, sling, speed-loading device and an AK-74 blade bayonet (many of which are left over in Germany from stocks of the former National People's Army).
