<COMMENT>Letter to Xander</COMMENT>

<P>XANDER! :p Took you long enough.

<P>You said you just needed to wash your hair. That was a year ago. I'm actually dying, you jerk.

<P>J/K, I'm doing fine.
<P>The Black Night! Of course. Wait, with you? Well, I don't know...

<P>J/K, again. Let's do it! We haven't met for ages!
<P>When will be good for you? :)

<P>

<P>>Hey, Nicole! How are you doing? Well, I hope.

<P>>Sorry for the long delay, you know how these things go. I'm a busy man...

<P>>What do you think about meeting me today or later tonight at the "Black Knight"?

<P>>

<P>>Xander
