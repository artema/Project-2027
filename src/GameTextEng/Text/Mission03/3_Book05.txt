<P>A Guide to Modern Weapons: Chapter 3: Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal's P90
<P>
<P>The FN P90 is a selective fire personal defense weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. The P90's name is taken from 1990, the year it was introduced. Created in response to NATO requests for a replacement to 9x19mm Parabellum firearms, it was designed as a compact but powerful weapon for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups. It was meant to replace the pistol-calibre submachine guns currently in use that had become ineffective against body armor.
<P>Though developed and initially marketed as a personal defense weapon, the P90 could also be considered a submachine gun or even a compact assault rifle. Featuring a compact bullpup design with an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls, the P90 is an unconventional weapon with a futuristic appearance. Its design incorporates several innovations such as a unique top-mounted magazine and FN's small caliber, high velocity 5.7x28mm ammunition. 
<P>The action is located behind the trigger group and alongside the shooter's face, so there is no wasted space for the buttstock as in conventional designs, permitting a shorter firearm length for the same barrel length for improved maneuverability and reduced weight, especially useful in armored vehicles or other tight spaces. It fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for further reduced weight and cost.
<P>Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5 kg (5.6 lb) empty, or 3 kg (6.6 lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.
<P>The P90's unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research and is notable for being fully ambidextrous. When fired, the P90 ejects spent cartridge casings downward through a chute located behind the grip, so spent cases are kept out of the shooter's line of sight.
