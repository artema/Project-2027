<COMMENT>Pocket PC on a box in the den of smugglers</COMMENT>

<P>One: Recieved another call from Mr. VS today. Bastard wants a "Tesla" tetanizing rifle, a guardian cyberbear, and 12 vials of Zyme. (Here's hoping he gets high, steps in a puddle, and electrocutes himself.)
<P>Two: got a message from Mrs. DN. Wants a Rockwell CZ-53 American machine-gun. Money is non-issue. Sounds great to me; we should try to snare her as a returning customer.
<P>Three: Delivery of Austrian silenced glock pistol to Mr. PDC went off without incident.
<P>Four: I declare a thumb war.
