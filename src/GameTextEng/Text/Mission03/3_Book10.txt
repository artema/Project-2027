<COMMENT>Папка на столе в полицейском участке</COMMENT>

<COMMENT>Assuming is some sort of police report.</COMMENT>

<P>...Based on the tip from Pierre's CI ********, and corroborated by ********, we acquired a warrant from Judge Ambrose and commenced the raid on ********* at 0400 yesterday morning.
<P>Though clear of hostiles, the ******* housed a mid-shipment cache likely in use by the smugglers containing large amounts of contraband.
<P>Of note were: 11 firearms (predominantly of Russian origin); over 10.000 rounds ammunition (of varying types and guages), and 5 kg of Zyme. (See Attachment 4: for a detailed listing).
<P>Despite the success of the operation, no information was found that might lead to the smuggler's central hide-out, and it is still unclear at this time just how large of an operation we might be up against. It is our suggestion that a special task force be set up to more thoroughly investigate and root out these smugglers. If we don't control the weapons and ammunition coming in, we predict a sharp rise in crime rates in the near future.
