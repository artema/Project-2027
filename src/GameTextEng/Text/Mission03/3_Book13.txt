<COMMENT>The book on the bed of the arms trader. Doesn't make much sense.</COMMENT>

<P>- 'No brick,' interrupted the stranger imposingly, 'will ever fall on someone's head just out of the blue. And in your particular case, I can assure you, you are not in danger of that at all. You will die a different death.'

<P>- Drawn inexplicably into the utterly absurd conversation, 'Ah, and are you the person,' Berlioz inquired ironically, 'to tell me exactly how?'

<P>- 'Absolutely,' responded the unknown man, and he proceeded to size Berlioz as if for a suit, mumbling to himself: 'One, two... Mercury in retrograde... the man on the moon... gone... six... yes, oh, disaster... evening... seven... hmph.' Suddenly, he stood up and joyfully announced...

<P>- 'Your head will be cut off! Decapitation! Marvelous!'
<P>- The homeless man goggled wildly and maliciously at the insouciant stranger, and Berlioz, grinning crookedly, asked,

<P> - 'No,' replied his interlocutor, 'by a beautiful Russain woman, part of the Komsomol.'

<P>- 'Well...' Berlioz muttered, starting to become vexed by the stranger's joke, 'excuse me, but I've had quite enough of this nonsense...'

<P>- 'And excuse me,' the foreigner replied more seriously, 'but it IS so... But, ah, yes,' more congenially, 'I've been wanting to ask, where are you headed tonight, if that is not too presumptuous a question?'

<P>- 'It is starting to be, but... I'll be stopping by my place on Sadovaya street, you may have heard of it, and later this evening I'll be chairing a meeting at Massolit...'

<P>- 'No. No, no, no. That just cannot be,' objected the foreigner.

<P>- 'Yes I am the chair...'

<P>- 'Because...' the foreigner replied, narrowed eyes pointed to the sky, where black birds traced noiselessly in anticipation of the evening's cool, 'Little Anna has already brought the sunflower oil, and has not only come with it, but has already spilled it. There was, no, is, no, will be no such meeting.'
