<P>Law Enforcement Officials are hard at work ensuring the safety of both citizens and guests of our great city of Paris. Crime statistics have dropped 23% since the PPD initiated its Renforce Nocturne des Patrouilles Speciales (RNPS) program. Everyone can feel safe while enjoying the Paris night life, knowing that a stalwart RNPS waits around every corner.
