<P>From: your landlord. Hello, my little dumplings, I just wanted to remind everyone to conserve water. Try not to leave the tap water running while you're not using it, mm'kay; what is the phrase, "leave some for the fishes?" Oh do be a dear and try to cut down on shower times also. Sex is better in bed anyway. he he he. I assure you, you'll thank me later. Our world's most precious resource just keeps getting more and more expensive.
