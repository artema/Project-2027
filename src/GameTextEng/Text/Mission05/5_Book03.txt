<P>I'm sick and tired of my job. Every day from the early dawn to dust I'm sitting here and guarding the main entrance. Got nothing to do, nothing at all. I think I'm gonna ask the captain to transfer me to another sector if nothing changes. I'm not gonna last here for long.

<P>Talked to the captain, and he doesn't mind! I'm glad, really glad, I think I'm gonna guard living quarters now. Yay, living quarters! Real people to talk to!
