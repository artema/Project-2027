<COMMENT>Omars correspondence (part 2).</COMMENT>
<P>Good day,
<P>Apparently, the communication protocol wasn't the course of the trouble. I hope that you can run testing software on your bot, and send us the results?
<P>I apologize for any inconvenience, again.
<P>We're happy that you liked our new rocket launcher.
<P>
<P>>Good day,
<P>>We've installed the patch you sent to me, but the error didn't disappear.
<P>>The last parcel has just been delivered. Indeed, that's the state-of-the-art in our business. This rocket launcher could replace good old RPG-7 and rob it of its laurels as the best model of anti-tank grenade launcher in the history!
