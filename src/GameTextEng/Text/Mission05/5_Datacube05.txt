<P>Recently I've had to spend an hour to get into the service sector! God damn security lock just wouldn't respond to any of the passwords. Turns out our mechanic had changed the password (again!) and forgotten to inform anyone about his deed of valor (again!). The commander gave me hell for being late. Okay, pal, I don't want you to experience that too, so here's the new password: 15668. I hope that IDIOT of a mechanic hasn't changed it again.
