<P>Korea has the nukes, but is left to quiet consultation and no war mongering. It has no oil. India and Pakistan are squabbling at their borders, and both have nukes, but you don't hear about military exercises near them, as they don't have oil. Russia has nukes and poison gas and bioterrorism means, but is an ally, because to take their oil from them would be difficult. Countries in Africa that find they have some oil are run like dictatorship by US corporations, killing off villages that object without fear of prosecution. So why is the Bush administration, so snug with Enron, with a history in the oil industry and utter lack of ethics such as Harken Energy, Haliburton, after in Iraq? Oil.
