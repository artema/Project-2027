<P><JC>Government to declare martial law on Moscow</JC>
<P>
<P>In view with the recent intensification of shooting on the streets the govenment is planning to impose a curfew in Moscow. The government believes that this is the least-evil solution but will help to suppress the riots and improve the safety of the civilians in the city.
<P>The curfew is active every day of the week (including holidays) from midnight to 7 am. The roads and other traffic arteries will open at 10 am. All private and state organizations are ordered to be closed from midnight to 10 am every day. The failure to obey this order will lead to a fine of 40,000 credits.
<P>Military police reserve a right to fire without warning. Patrol bots will attack any perpetrator seen outside during the curfew.
<P>We hope that the inhabitants of Moscow will understand the necessity that leads us to making this decision.
