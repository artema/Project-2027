<P>After the yesterday's breakdown I had to decrease the generator output by 30%. 2-A and 2-C modules were cut off, as well as the first and second gates of the main facility. Until the generator stabilizes its functions, I don't advise anyone to increase the output by more than 5%. I've changed the access password, too, just in case. New password: 25479. The next password change is scheduled for next week.
