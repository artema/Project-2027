<P>Prior to September 11, the US was isolationist and arrogant, breaking treaties and increasing its arms. It was poised to take what it needed from a faltering world, and to hell with any other needy country. In the month following September 11, the US became almost humble, trotting the globe to make friends recently snubbed, and making concessions. Once again, the hand mailing Anthrax may be those who do not fear to die, in a Jihad against the hated US, but those supplying them are a complex of countries who formerly called the US a friend, but had been stunned to find treaties such as the treasured arms reduction treaty treated like toilet paper in a plan to make the US the biggest gun on the globe.
