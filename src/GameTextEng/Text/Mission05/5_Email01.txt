<P>>I've been relocated to the main research facility today and given a very own office to pursue my studies. I've been waiting so long, and at last it's happening! I'll do my best to fulfill my boss's expectations. At last! An opportunity to devote the whole of myself to the development of Artifical Intelligence.
<P>>I'm terribly sorry, but at the moment I can't afford writing a full-blown message. I'm gonna talk to you later!
<P>> - Dmitry

<P>Hey hey!
<P>I'm happy to hear that you're doing all right. Hope that now we can meet more often, right? And yeah, how does it feel like, to see the sundown... from down there?
