<P>Well, that's all right, I'm gonna take you to a good long hung, like in the old times, we're old timers now, pal :o) I'm sorry to say that, but the "game" here is, well, crocodiles and more crocodiles. No boars, no luck.
<P>Please, inform me as soon as you settle on visiting! I'll meet ya', pal, first-rate delivery straight from the airport, you're gonna like it.
<P>
<P>>I'm sorry for the long response.
<P>>No prob, I'll be glad the swap this anthill for your wild (whatever)!
<P>>I'm just not ready yet. Sorry, pal, I've got stuff to do, yes, right here, in this anthill.
<P>>Remember the last time we met? That's also the last time I went fishing / hunting / general outdoors! Sad but true. By the way, what kind of game do you have there?
