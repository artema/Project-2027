<P>I've finished my work with a new augmentation module. You can pay me a visit today, right in my office, and make sure that the module functions properly. I've shielded the carrier container to make sure it's safe. To turn off the shields you'll need a password: 6524. If anything goes according to the plan, I think I might get a job in the governmental office - dealing with the new designs and developments! I really hope I'm getting it.
<P>P.S. my next message, if any, you'll find at the same place as this one. I don't want anyone to find out anything about OUR business.
