<P>2 years have passed since the day I ran away. I knew too much and had to pay for it with my life and blood.

<P>14th June of 2027, Wednesday
<P>I've had time to think about what would have happened to me if I decided to participate in the project? Probably would be one of the SWAT troopers right now, allowed to visit my old cottage in the countryside once in a year. I would have to hide away, I wouldn't have to act out own death. Was it worth it, or was it not?...
