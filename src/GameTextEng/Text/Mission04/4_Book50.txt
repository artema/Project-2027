<P>Do the royalty of Europe run the world? Do the heads of organized religions, the Vatican, run the world? On what basis? It is wealth that runs the world, from purchasing cooperation from corporations, which they own, to assisting their Puppets into political power via their control of the media and assets to be used for bribery and coercion. The members of the Illuminati seek favors from the Puppet Master, and offer services, and in this regards act as a supplicant, not a master.
