<P>In the recent past, humans considered the world around them to be composed of either mass or energy. Mass being the 'stuff' that made up the universe, while energy was a cosmological book keeping system for keeping track of what is moving and what has the potential to move, with the key feature being that energy is a constant. Then in 1905, Albert Einstein, one of the leading physicists of the early twentieth century, published his "Annus Mirabilis" papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of matter and energy, which would change humankind's understanding of the universe forever.
<P>In, "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light", Einstein demonstrated the energy quanta concept of light, that is that energy consists of discrete packets, or photons. The theory of light quanta was a strong indicator of wave-particle duality, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, which would be further explored by Heisenberg and Schrodinger. A complete picture of the theory of photoelectricity was realized after the maturity of quantum mechanics.
<P>In "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?", Einstein walked through the derivation of his famous equation E=mc^2. Original of the form, mass lost = L/c^2 (energy lost over the speed of light squared) obtained through an analysis of stationary and moving reference frames with respect to his theory of relativity. Suddenly, mass and energy could no longer be thought of as being separate physical entities.
