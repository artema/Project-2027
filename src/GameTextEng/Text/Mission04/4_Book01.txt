<P>Daniel, I don't have time to give you the tour but here are some things to keep in mind during your visit:

<P> - Keep your distance from both the cops and the Asura. The police have happy trigger fingers lately; and the Asura don't like strangers.

<P> - A curfew is in effect. Use the underground. Still illegal, of course, and I don't think you'll be able to persuade the conductor to give you a ride. Find Evgeni (address in the datacube on the table) - he may be able to help. If all else fails do what your best at, improvise something.
<P> - One last thing, there is another address in the datacube. Knowing you, you have a weapon and aren't afraid of a little risk; pay that address a visit.

<P> - Enjoy your stay, Daniel.
