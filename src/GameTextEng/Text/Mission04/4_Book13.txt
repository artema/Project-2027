<P>...One of the more interesting discoveries in astronomy towards the end of the twentieth century was that of the 'accelerating universe'.
<P>While chemistry had already shown to scientists the ever increasing entropic nature of the universe, it came as quite a shock to learn, thanks to the applicaton of doppler analysis on cosmic background radiation, that the universe appears to be expanding at an ever increasing rate as well.
<P>These observations have continued to be corroborated by many independent sources: the cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure of the universe, the age of the universe, as well as improved measurements of supernovas, and X-ray properties of galaxy clusters.
<P>An interesting side effect of an expanding universe is the decrease in all density as space continues to be added between all matter. If acceleration continues, eventually all galaxies beyond our own local supercluster will redshift so far that it will become extremely difficult to detect them, and the distant universe will turn dark.
<P>Some scientists have put forth the idea of a cold empty death for the universe as divergent acceleration overtakes gravity. Measurements of acceleration therefore are thought crucial to determining the ultimate fate of the universe, however we should expect the implications of such a major discovery to develop slowly over many years in the same way the big bang model has continued to develop...
