<P>The White Movement
<P>"White Army" redirects here. For other uses, see *White Army (disambiguation)*.
<P>The White movement (Russian: Б?лое движенiе/Белое движение, tr. Beloye dvizheniye) and its military arm the White Army (Б?лая Армiя/Белая Армия, Belaya Armiya) - known as the White Guard (Б?лая Гвардiя/Белая Гвардия, Belaya Gvardiya) or the Whites (Белые and белогвардейцы "White Guardsmen") - was a loose confederation of Anti-Communist counter-revolutionary forces.
<P>The movement comprised one of the politico-military Russian forces who fought the "Red" Bolsheviks in the former Russian Empire after the October Revolution, and then against the Red Army in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1917-23). The movement's only lasting success was achieved by Mannerheim, military chief of the Finnish White Guard, who defeated the Reds and communists in the Duchy of Finland and secured the nation's independence.
