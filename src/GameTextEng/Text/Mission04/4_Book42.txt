<P><JC>Russian Confederation in 2027</JC>
<P>
<P>After collapse of Russian Confederation and China intervention millions of refugees rushed to the central Russia trying to escape the ethnic cleansing started on the newly independent territories and the regions occupied by Chinese. The inhabitants of the far and remote regions usually joined the ranks of the fugitives, afraid of the imminent collapse of the central government and the further advance of Chinese troops. The Russian government had to look for the means to provide all the refugees with housing and food, and to start creating new working places. FSB was blamed for the repression actions in the past and disbanded. The Russian Confederation per se ceased to exist.
<P>The responsibility to restore the order was put on the police. More than 60% of military personnel were dismissed, as a result the frontier guard lost control over the border, and a massive surge of Chinese immigrants entered the vacant territories. According to different sources, from 25 to 30 million illegal Chinese immigrants are found within the borders of Confederation at any given time. The new governmental program "Affordable Housing for the Refugees" was soon dropped due to the corruption of the appointed officials. Low life quality and the lack of working positions led to the constant rise in crime rates, and the gradual deteriorating of the central government control over financial and economical affairs in the country. Many areas of economic activity and even some major cities are currently administered by the self-appointed leaders of the criminal gangs. The government is desperately trying to restore the order. One of the last measures taken was the introduction of curfew zones in Moscow.
