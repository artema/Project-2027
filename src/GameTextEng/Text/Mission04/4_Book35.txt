<P>Humans have a long standing tradition - when one doesn't know what to do about an issue, form a committee. Thus it was that the Bilderberg Group formed. It is not hard to imagine the state of affairs after Roswell. The heads of state of US allies and their close confidants, chairmen of major US or international companies and their confidants, and a number of scientists from prestigious universities or institutes were aware of the alien presence but were unsure what this meant for the future of the Earth. Were the aliens friendly as stated, or deceptive? The answer, as we have explained, is both, but to humans who considered themselves leaders the answer was not at all clear, and many still do not have it sorted out today. They tend to lump all alien visitors together and thus endlessly discuss all manner of speculation on what might be unfolding.
<P>The membership of the Bilderberg Group changes over time, but only slightly, as the original group was tasked with sorting out the issues and coming forth with recommendations, and the mission is not yet accomplished. They meet periodically, in secret, here and there around the face of the globe. They start up where they left off at the last meeting, and churn the issues and possibilities until they again become exhausted. Like most committees that cannot come up with an action plan, the only thing they accomplish is their self perpetuation. 
<P>The Bilderberg Group is meeting for 2006 in Ottowa. Per Alex Jones on Prison Planet there were 123 participants on the list for 2004. 32% were corporate, CEO or directors, 30% were political, heads of state or ministers or in parliament, 16% represent institutes, foundations, or universities with a focus on economics, 15% were financial, representing banks or investment firms, and 7% were media representatives, editors and the like. What are they up to.
