<P>I first became aware of all the seriousness of the UFO threat many years ago. At the moment I was occupying one of the key posts in the American Military Intelligence. I'd been observing the situation and had an access to all the relevant information since the last days of the WW2. The undercover activity never ceased during the years of Cold War. Moreover, I noticed that it often TARGETED American democracy and American people! 
<P>Me and the other Old Boys - Jewson Bishop the Third, William "Sand Snake" Hamilton, Bill "Brenton" Cuper - we managed to uncover a lot of data about the Secret Government. I got an access to a lot of classified information about the UFO activity, and at some point started my own investigation. I can tell that certain civilian authorities, as well as some Intelligence people didn't like me nosing around. 
<P>I was among the first to notice the connection between the frequency of UFO observations and the rise of totalitarianism in certain countries. The UFO investigators today still demonstrate their reluctance to notice this connection, I wonder whether they can't see it - or simply afraid to speak up. 
<P>At some point I faced a horrible realization. I found out what is truly happening to our planet, I discovered certain forces that infiltrated everything, they controlled both civilian and military authorities, their presence could be tracked everywhere. Fortunately, I could continue working on my project and retain my position in the Military Intelligence Service. I was investigating the conspiracy - under the conspirators' very nose, so to say.
<P>During that very stressful investigation, while trying to puzzle out my answers, I came in contact with many officers of the Military Intelligence some of which had been performing identical researches on their own. I'm still in touch with many of them. Of course, I can't disclose their names and positions without betraying their trust and our work.
