<COMMENT>Vladimir correspondence (part 1).</COMMENT>
<P>Hi, Vlad.
<P>Nope, still a bachelor. :)
<P>Living with Yanka at the moment, got a new job, too...
<P>Just like in that old toon, remember - wonderful, just wonderful!
<P>The nature here, i wish you could see it... it's so beautiful! Leave that anthill of yours and come here!
<P>Make sure you're not using Russian airlines, with all those terrorist douches and their explosions, and the cops everywhere... I wouldn't advise that.
<P>Take a train to Paris, and take a plane from Paris, that's a good plan!
<P>I think that we'll find a work here for you here, so... time to pack your things and go?
<P>
<P>>Hello, Seryoga!
<P>>
<P>>What's up? Any good news?
<P>>How's your new home? Got a wife yet? :o)
<P>>Anything new worth mentioning to an old friend?
<P>>
<P>>Your old friend, Vlad
