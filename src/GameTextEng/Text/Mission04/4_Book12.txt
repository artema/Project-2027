<P>ZetaTalk: Planetary Magnetism
<P>Feb 15, 1996. Planet X and the 12th Planet are one and the same. 
<P>
<P>...Planets act as magnets in accordance with their composition and liquidity. In this regard the Earth is a magnet, as it has a high concentration of iron in both its core and crust, and its core is fluid. The strongest magnets are produced from softened or melted ore, as the atoms are free to line up end to end. The core of the Earth is perpetually in this state, and thus it acts like a huge magnet, as large as the globe itself. The Earth's crust is magnetically diffuse, representing many different pole alliances over the eons, as magma hardened after volcanic eruptions during pole shifts. The Earth's thick crust acts as a shield in this way, so that only sensitive needles on compasses, floating freely, jiggle into alignment with the Earth's core.
<P>A planet's magnetic influence is not encapsulated by its crust, but reaches beyond this even to the ends of the solar system. Like the shields that men stood behind to watch an atomic blast, they may have avoided the radiation, but the landscape behind them was devastated. The Earth's magnetism oozes around the various crustal plates acting as shields to recreate its essential alignment out in space, considering any confusion the crust may have presented as no more than an annoyance. A resonance is involved, so that the magnetic field can reestablish itself, filling in any blanks. Thus, when magnetized planets encounter each other, such as when the 12th Planet passes near the Earth, the strength of their reaction to each other is much greater than man might imagine...
