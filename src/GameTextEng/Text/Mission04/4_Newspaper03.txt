The Gosduma spokeperson Gennadiy Anisimov had a private meeting with the president last night and informed the journalists about the new decision made by the head of state.
<P>According to G. Anisimov, he explained to the president the possibility of a conflict due to the current government opinion that the article 100 of the document should be removed. G. Seleznyov maintains that the president expressed his consent for the additional discussion of the article 100 during the next Gosduma session planned for 22nd February. The budgetary discussion will also continue in parliament during that session. "This unfortunate article should not be linked with our search of additional funds for the settlement of Paris Club debt" - said Seleznyov.
