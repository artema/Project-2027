<P> - A moment please, Mr. President. Under the authority granted me as director of weapons research and development, I commissioned last year a study of this project by the Bland coporation. Based on findings of my report, my conclusion was that this idea was not a practical deterrent, for reasons which, at the moment, must be all too obvious.
<P> - Then you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing?
<P> - Mr. President, the technology required is easily within the means of even the smallest nuclear power. It requires only the will to do so.
<P> - But, how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically, and at the same time impossible to untrigger?
<P> - Mr. President, it is not only possible it is essential. That is the whole idea of this machine, you know. Deterrence is the art of prdoucing in the mind of the enemy... the fear to attack. And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision making process which rules out human meddling, the doomsday machine is terrifying. It's simple to understand. And completely credible, and convincing.
<P> -- *Gee, wish we had one of them doomsday machines.*
<P> - But this is fantastic, Strangelove. How can it be triggered automatically?
<P> - Well, it's remarkably simple to do that. when you merely wish to bury bombs, there is no limit to the size. After that they are connected to a gigantic complex of computers. Now then, a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances, under which the bombs are to be exploded, is programmed into the memory bank.
<P> -- *Strangelove. What kind of name is that?*
<P> --- *He changed it when he became a citizen. Used to be Merkwurkdigliebe.*
<P> --*Hmm. A kraut, by any other name, huh, Stainsy?*
<P> - Yes, but the... whole point of the doomsday machine... is lost... if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh?
