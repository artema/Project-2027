<P><JC>Consequences of the Caucasian War and the collapse of Russian Confederation</JC>
<P>
<P>Interim president Alexander Torshin announced that the war launched by Russia against its own republics was illegitimate and even, moreover, unconstitutional - the fifth article of the constitution guarantees the self-determination rights for the nations of Russian Confederation. Torshin ordered the start of referendum that would leave every subject of Russian Confederation a right to define its own status, independently from other subjects or the central government. "Russian Confederation is a peaceful country, we're not forcing anyone to be a part of it" - declared president.
<P>Russian Confederation had been officially declared a confederation which implies that each member of it stays or goes at its own will. After the referendum 12 national republics decided that they would be better off without Russia. Some of the regions used the power of local parliaments to negotiate the right of associated membership in the new confederation - with a right of renewal. The new government needed money to restore the economy, and to further secure its position. The pre-term presidential elections in the beginning of 2017 brought victory to the Torshin fraction. After much debate the new government decided to sell the Kaliningrad Region to German Federal Republic for 100 billion Euros, as well as to cede the territory of Kurile Islands, South Sakhalin and South-West Kamchatka to Japan for 180 billion USD, plus a credit for 50 billion USD more.
