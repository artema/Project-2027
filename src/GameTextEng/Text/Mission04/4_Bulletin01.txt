<P><JC>Government to Declare Martial Law in Moscow</JC>
<P>
<P>Due to the recent escalation of firefights and violence in the capital, local officials have called for the Confederation Army to step in and take control of the situation. A curfew is now in affect, as General-Mayor Feofilakt Vassily hopes to begin to suppress the sporadic rioting and immediately ensure the safety of civilians within the city.
<P>The curfew is active every day of the week (including holidays) 7 pm to 7 am. All roads and other travelways will open at 7:30 am. All private and state organizations will be closed from 6 pm to 8 am every day. Failure to comply may lead to fines in excess of 40,000 credits and/or incarceration without trial for the duration of martial law.
<P>Military police retain and may exercise the right to fire without warning. Patrol bot targeting heuristics will make no distinction between law abiding citizens late on their way home and potentially dangerous suspects. They will neutralize any possible threat.
<P>Above all, we care about our citizens. Comply with this and all further directives to help ensure your own, and your comardes', safety and livelihood. Always defer to the requests of authorized military and law enforcement personnel. Report any suspicious behavior either to a patrol (inside curfew hours) or at our National Emergency Hotline.
