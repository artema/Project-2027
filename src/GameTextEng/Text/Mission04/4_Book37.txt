<P>The black helicopters are housed at private facilities, the perfect cover. A barn, a warehouse, or a hollow dirt mound work as well as a vacant hangar at a private landing strip. Helicopters, of course, need only a spot to land upon, and can be draped with camouflage cloth or have collapsible walls of a shack or garage erected around it once landed. In a sheltered and isolated spot, such activity goes unnoticed, with the exit and return of the chopper accomplished in minutes.
<P>How does this enterprise learn who the contactees or UFOlogists are, and of their schedules and routes? Consider for a moment the number of ex-government agents, of all flavors, who are expert at tapping phones and at effective surveillance and, in particular, at infiltrating groups such as contactee support groups. Establishment groups who can afford fleets of sleek choppers can certainly lure ex-CIA members into their employ. And the new employer is not asking them to do anything they haven't already been doing - just a new pair of shoes.
