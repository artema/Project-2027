<P>Quantum cryptography describes the use of quantum mechanical effects (in particular quantum communication and quantum computation) to perform cryptographic tasks or to break cryptographic systems. The use of classical (i.e., non-quantum) cryptography to protect against quantum attackers is also often considered as quantum cryptography (in this case, one also speaks of post-quantum cryptography).
<P>Well-known examples of quantum cryptography are the use of quantum communication to securely exchange a key (quantum key distribution) and the (hypothetical) use of quantum computers that would allow the breaking of various popular public-key encryption and signature schemes (e.g., RSA and ElGamal).
<P>The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical (i.e., non-quantum) communication (see below for examples). In particular, quantum mechanics guarantees that measuring quantum data disturbs that data; this can be used to detect an adversary's interference with a message.
<P>However, researchers at the University of Toronto and a joint collaboration of NTNU and Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light have shown that undetected quantum hacking might be possible in a variety of implementations of quantum key distribution systems.
