<P>The night before found both he and I in the repository - the sun was already going down and all I had to do was shrug out of my lab coat and I'd be heading to the Borscht for a drop or two of the old stiff stuff. There I was, leaning against the wall, all of my work done and a cigarette between my fingers. By that time I was dying for a cig - it had been two hours, and he was still puttering around with his stuff.
<P>Having loaded, locked, and sealed one safe, he was still busy loading up the second - empties come out of the transporter, get examined from every possible angle (and they're heavy little bastards, by the way, around fifteen pounds), then get put up on the shelf. He'd been working with those empties forever, without success, and the way I see it, without any benefit to either humanity or himself. I would have said fuck it long ago and gone to work on something else that paid just as well. On the other hand, once you think about it, empties really are something remarkably mysterious, probably incomprehensible. I've handled quite a few of them myself, but I never get used to them. Two copper disks about the size of a saucer - that is a quarter inch thick, with a space of a foot and a half between them.
<P>Between them, there's nothing. Just empty space. You can stick your hand in, hell, even your head, if you are so inclined. Absolutely nothing. Nevertheless, there is a mighty strong 'force', or something at work here. No one can press them together, nor has anyone been able to pull them apart.
