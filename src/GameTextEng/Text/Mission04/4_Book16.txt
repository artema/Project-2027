<P>Once Eintein had broached the answer and question of the wave-particle duality of matter and energy, the science of quantum mechanics followed swiftly, developed first by Werner Heisenberg in 1925. Quantum mechanics describes the time evolution of physical systems via a mathematical structure called the wave function (developed by Schrodinger). The wave function encapsulates the probability that the system is to be found in a given state at a given time. Fundamentally, it attempts to explain the peculiar behaviour of matter and energy at the subatomic level — an attempt which has produced more accurate results than classical physics in predicting how individual particles behave. However, many unexplained anomalies remain, given the difficult nature of observing the atomic and sub-atomic worlds. If one were asked to compute the amount of water required to turn a water wheel at such a speed and for such a duration, but were not told that the temperature on occasion would be below freezing or that at other times the water would flood and reverse the direction of water flow - the computations would invariably be wrong.
<P>Quantum mechanics balances out what it does not know with careful observation and statistical analysis, so the formulas are the result of observed facts and behavior, not theory. In this regard they are accurate, but where the science begins to go amuck is in the theoretical aspect, where data tied to observed facts is expected to take second place to theories - the facts to follow the theory. This has lead to a multitude of (perhaps conflicting) esoteric theories about the nature of the universe yet to be proven or even completely understood. Nevertheless, these theories compel scientists to find ways of experimentally supporting or countering the consequents of the theories, driving forward the exploration of the sub-atomic world.
