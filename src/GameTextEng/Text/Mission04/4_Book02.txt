<P>Dead Hand (known as 'Perimeter') is rumored to be a Cold-War era nuclear-control failsafe still in place in Russia. Designed to plug all holes in the military doctrine of mutually assured destruction, Dead Hand automatically triggers the launch of Russain Nuclear ICBM's in the event of a nuclear strike on Russian soil. Utilizing a network of seismic, radiation, radioactivity, and pressure sensors fed into a massive super computer control system, Dead Hand provides second strike capability even in the event of the complete destruction of Soviety leadership. By most accounts, the device is normally disabled; only activated in the event of extreme crisis (in American terms: DEFCON 5).
