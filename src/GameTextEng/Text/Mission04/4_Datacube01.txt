<P>Daniel, I think you'll want to listen up,
<P>One of my good acquaintences should be able to help you. Evgeny is the man you want. He's got connections all over the city, and knows it like the back of his hand too. Drop my name when you meet him. That should at least get him talking to you. He's an astute operator, got him to where he is now; so don't expect him to do you any favors out of the kindness of his heart. He's good to his 'friends' though, if you understand what I mean. Do what he wants... but not for free. He's cynical and slightly paranoid, so always show your motivations, don't let him wonder. He'll also be the guy you want to see for equipment... gives great discounts to 'friends'. 
<P>
<P>You'll likely find him in the basement of the big yellow building with an arch in block 1b on the Yauzsky Bulvar. Last time I was there, password was 7684, but that was a while ago, and he might have changed it since then. 
<P>
<P>I'm done here. Good luck.
