<P><JC>The transcription of the speech at the Plenary Meeting of Gosduma regarding the implementation of the new federal law: "the Gosduma observers in the operational areas on the Chechen republic territory and the adjacent territories" </JC>

<P>
<P>Esteemed members of Gosduma!
<P>
<P>Today we're going to discuss the new federal bill concerning the Gosduma observers in the operational areas on the Chechen republic territory and the adjacent territories. We believe that the Gosduma fractions should show the determination in passing this bill, and would like you to do anything to speed up the process. If the esteemed members of fractions are willing to let the bill pass, we would like it to happen in the nearest future. We need our observers deployed on the battlefield by the holidays in May. It was proposed that their number should be proportional to the number of the members in our fractions. We plan to send the observers to the operational areas, as well as to the number of population centers and troop commands. Personally I believe that it will allow us to save many innocent lives - on either side.
<P>I've visited the Chechen republic in the last week, and have had an opportunity to talk to our generals and the administration on the local level there, to find out what they really think and what's really happening there. A first hand experience is always important in our business. They had been informing me about all the recent happenings, enemy attacks, air strikes. As it turned out, our aviation was unable to retaliate upon the enemy, neither our artillery could - simply because the equipment was out of working order. There was an attack made on our positions, apparently by civilians, and then another one against our military unit, this time by regular troops.
<P>Now for the most interesting part, the local administration didn't report any of this. We need to be receiving all the relevant and precise information about what's happening on the battlefields, and for that we can't rely on the local administration alone. On this basis we would like to propose to send our, Gosduma's, observers down there. All the factions are encouraged to do so. The observers sent by Gosduma automatically obtain an official appointment of deputy assistant. We believe that they could provide the information we need faster and more accurate, which in turn would allow us to get a handle of the situation in the republics, and to start acting as a law-making body should act.
