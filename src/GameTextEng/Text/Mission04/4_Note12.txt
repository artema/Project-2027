<P>Today at 00.24 am a black military helicopter was detected flying over the city. Presumably, it was an American helicopter. We've tried to track it down but failed, looks like it was using thermo-optical camouflage.
<P>Report to the command center immediately if the helicopter appears on radar again. We must find and destroy it.
