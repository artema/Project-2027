<P><JC>-- Dissolution of the Soviet Union --</JC>
<P>
<P>The dissolution of the Soviet Union was the disintegration of the federal political structures and central government of the Soviet Union, resulting in the independence of all 15 republics of the Soviet Union between March 11, 1990 and December 25, 1991.
<P>The direct cause of the dissolution was the failed attempt by Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the USSR from March 11, 1985, to revitalize the Soviet economy through a process of limited political liberalisation (glasnost/perestroika) within the confines of a totalitarian communist one-party state.
<P>The broader result of the dissolution was the fall of Communism as a global ideology between 1989 and 1991 and the end of the cold war. Multi-ethnic communist federal states proved particularly vulnerable to disintegration during this time - the Soviet Union was but one example of three such states that collapsed in Europe as a result of the fall of communism, the others being the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, which broke up in a series of wars in 1991-1992, and Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, which had its peaceful velvet divorce in 1993.
