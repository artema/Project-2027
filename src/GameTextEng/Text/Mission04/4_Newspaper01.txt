<P><JC>Another Suicide Bomber in Moscow</JC>
<P>
<P>
<P>Yesterday Moscow experienced yet another terrorist attack - one of the largest so far. The suicide bomber set off his explosives in an overcrowded metro train. The exact number of victims is still unknown. The suggested death toll for this event is at the moment rising to 100, and about as many were injured. The number of people suffering from shock and psychological traumas are beyond count. The worst of all is that the terrorists managed to explode the bomb despite the FSB patrolling the area: the agency was informed about the plans for an attack.
<P>The explosion went off at 8.30 am in a train on the route from the "Avtozavodskaya" to "Paveletskaya" metro stations.
<P>The explosion caused the second car to swell up like a balloon, and crumpled the third. Momentarily the windows shot out, and the nauseous smell of burned meat filled the air. Some of the passengers in the cars nearby were hit by the glass shreds. The explosion wave reflected and magnified by the walls of the underground tunnel broke the windows in the rest of the train, causing even more injuries. The train was still on the move when the explosion wave threw the glass and the remnants of the passengers out of the broken panes, sometimes hitting the ones who were still alive.
<P>The method of bomb activation is still unknown. The experts believe that the answer will be very hard to find: the remnants of hundreds of different electronic devices, CD players, cell-phones, toys, notebooks were found broken and partially melted on the scene. Theoretically, any of those could be used to trigger the explosion by the terrorist.
<P>The suicide bomber's identity is still under question. After the suicide bomber activated his bomb not too much of his body was left to identify. Typically it's just the head and feet, and sometimes hands as well if 1.5 - 2 kg of plastic explosives were used. In this case the terrorist was carrying 5 kg. The investigators point out that it should, theoretically, cause the body to "break down into molecules". In other words, it's unlikely that the body of the terrorist will be ever found, and even if some part of it survived the explosion, it would be very hard to identify it, since the car is full of the mutilated bodies of passengers.
