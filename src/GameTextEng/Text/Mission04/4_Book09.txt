<P>...Every thirty-five hours, or thereabouts, Amaltheia will make one full rotation about its axis, while it takes only twelve hours to complete its orbit around Jupiter. This is why every thirteen and a half hours, Jupiter rears its enourmous shapless head. It's a spectacular sight, and to see it all you'd want to take the spectrolite-dome lift to the top floor. As soon as your eyes become accustomed to the darkness, an ice-bound plain would slowly materialize and recede to the serrated mountain range on the horizon. Bright unblinking stars would stud a black sky, shedding a faint light on the icy plain, while the pitch-black mountain range would sit like a cut-out on an otherwise starry sky. Look long enough and you'd begin to make out the jagged tops, unless you get lucky, and Ganymede's mottled crescent or Callisto's silver disc or perhaps more rarely still both hang above the range. In which case the plain grey fingers would stretch from one end to the other across the gleaming ice.
<P>Watch the Sun come up in a small ball of blinding fire, and suddenly the plain turns blue, while black shadows outline every crack and hump. Coal-black spots on the spacefield look like big freshly-frozen puddles and I guarentee you'd feel like running over that thin crust of ice to hear it crunch under your magnetic boots and see it fan out in dark wrinkles...
