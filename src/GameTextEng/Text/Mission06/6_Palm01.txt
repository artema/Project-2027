<P>You'll have to get the main elevator (the one that will take you to the base levels of the facility) from the officer in command of security guards. The commander is the last to come down to the shelter. He has to check all the locks and protection systems on the level before that. If there's an intruder in the bunker, he's the one responsible for it, and it's unlikely that he'll decide to shirk his duties.
